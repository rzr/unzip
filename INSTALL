the Info-Zip decompression program, version 6.x. You have to download the
currently supported version (see below) from their homepage (http://www.info-zip.org)
and put the unchanged archive into this directory, then you may run

	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -sa -B -i

to build a binary .deb package.

Currently supported version:    6.0
Expected archive name:          unzip60.tar.gz
Last working URL:               http://sourceforge.net/projects/infozip/files/UnZip%206.x%20%28latest%29/UnZip%206.0/unzip60.tar.gz/download
